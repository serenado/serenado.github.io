					<p >On Thursday, May 14th, Medford High School’s Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA) hosted a gender and sexuality identity workshop featuring three members from PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians and Gays).  These three trans-identifying individuals from PFLAG held an open panel tackling issues and stereotypes regarding transgender topics and how Medford High can become a better environment for individuals of all genders. It began with educational lessons on terminology used within the spectrum of sexuality, gender identity, and expression. Afterward, a discussion-based forum opened where the PFLAG representatives demonstrated their charisma and shared their personal stories, graciously entertaining everyone’s questions and comments.
